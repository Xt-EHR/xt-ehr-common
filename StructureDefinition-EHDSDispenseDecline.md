Explicit statement about declining the dispense request (prescription), usually recorded in order to communicate the issue back to the prescriber. Reasons for declining a dispense may vary, but typically this statement is only sent when a following action is expected on the prescriber’s side (cancelling or changing the problematic prescription or the whole treatment).
