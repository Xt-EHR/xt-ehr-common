Medical devices and implants is suggested as a mandatory section of Patient Summary. Implementers should as a minimum be able to produce a list of devices and give an empty list reason if there are no devices. The only required element for each listed device, is specifying the device. The information elements for each device are listed in the EHDS-PS-Device model.   
If the producing system have no record of devices to list (e.g. the patient has no devices, or the system have no device information), it must provide a reason for the empty list. This is similar to the other mandatory sections, and in accordance with the specification in ISO IPS.  
 
Receiving systems must be able to handle the data and are encouraged to display the received information to the user but are not obliged to do so.  

The information elements and value sets suggested is taken from eHN GL, MyHealth@EU and HL7 FHIR IPS.
