In Patient Summary Guideline there are two sections containing problems: "Current problems" and "Resolved, closed or inactive problems". In MyHealth@EU specifications and International Patient Summary "Current problems" is a mandatory section, while "Resolved, closed or inactive problems" is not.  However, in clinical practice the status of a problem is not regularly recorded or updated in this way. Problems are recorded as they are found and treated, but usually not maintained in always updated separate lists of past and current problems. Having it mandatory to place problems into either of the two categories (past or current), even in cases where this is not explicitly set, could force systems to have to deduce/infer or base on rules based on dates or other available paramenters. This could lead to medically incorrect data. Having just one problems section, prevent systems from having to make improper assumptions. Since the European exchange format will support different uses cases, we suggest that it is up to the implementers of different use cases (profiles) to decide whether a strict division between past and present problems are achievable and desirable. The proposed model has one section for problems, but each problem listed can have a status that would place it within a specific category (active, inactive).
