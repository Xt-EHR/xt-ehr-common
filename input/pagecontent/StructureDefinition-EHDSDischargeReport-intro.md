Feedback is welcome on any aspect of the content.<br>
However, the following topics have been identified as areas where input would be particularly valuable:<br>  
  
<li><strong>Pharmacotherapy section.</strong> Is the section's purpose clear and the section useful in its current definition? Are the current implementations using the same approach, or is the section's content conveyed in the Medication Summary section? <br>
<li><strong>Diagnostic Summary section.</strong> Is the section together with EHDSCondition model sufficient for capturing details related to a hospital encounter diagnostics?
<li><strong>Medication Summary section.</strong> In some jurisdictions, any handover of a medication to the patient at the time of discharge is marked in the report. Is the model capturing the information expected for this use case, or would it be captured better using EHDSMedicationDispense model.
