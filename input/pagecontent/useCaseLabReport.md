### FHIR Implementation Guide

Laboratory Report FHIR Implementation Guide has been published by HL7 Europe ([published version](https://hl7.eu/fhir/laboratory/index.html)).
Latest build version can be found [here](https://build.fhir.org/ig/hl7-eu/laboratory/). The changes proposed by Xt-EHR project and approved by the community will be included in the future version of the specification.

MyHealth@EU has adopted HL7 Europe's FHIR IG for laboratory report crossborder service (see [crossborder adaption](https://fhir.ehdsi.eu/laboratory/)).
