Patient summary consists of several sections of which some are suggested to be mandatory to support. For each mandatory section, implementers should as a minimum be able to produce a generated narrative text of the content, as well as certain structured elements. There are only few elements that are suggested as required to support at this point. 

While the overall use cases for exchanging a full Patient Summary (PS) remain consistent—typically aiming to support patients access to its own data, transfer of data between systems and cross-border care (both emergency access, and continuity of care)—it is acknowledged that, in practice, implementers will need to support multiple variants of these use cases, depending on the context. 
In some cases, only a subset of the PS (e.g. just medications, allergies, or vaccinations) will be relevant or exchanged. As such, each section of the Patient Summary is described and handled independently, with clear guidance on both the narrative and structured data elements expected for that section. 

The information elements and value sets suggested are mainly taken from eHN Guideline, MyHealth@EU and HL7 FHIR IPS. Some additions or adjustments have been made, based on input from the working group of this deliverable. These are described in each section.
