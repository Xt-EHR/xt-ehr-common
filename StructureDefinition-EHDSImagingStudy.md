## Logical Model: Imaging study model 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Official URL*:http://www.xt-ehr.eu/fhir/models/StructureDefinition/EHDSImagingStudy | *Version*:0.2.1 |
| Draft as of 2025-10-10 | *Computable Name*:EHDSImagingStudy |

 
Imaging study model includes the key information about the content of an imaging study. It does not include image pixels but includes location pointers to its image content and organises this information according to the well-established model of an imaging study made of one or more series and each series made of instances or images. Composed of a set of data (DICOM KOS) that facilitates the location of all available images. 

**Usages:**

* Use this Logical Model: [Imaging report model](StructureDefinition-EHDSImagingReport.md) and [Observation model](StructureDefinition-EHDSObservation.md)
