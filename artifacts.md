## Artifacts Summary

This page provides a list of the FHIR artifacts defined as part of this implementation guide.

### EHDS Patient Summary Logical Models 

Information Models for implementing EEHRxF Patient Summary under EHDS. Format based on ISO 13972 "Health informatics — Clinical information models — Characteristics, structures and requirements. The Patient Summary is currently being defined in a [separate branch](https://build.fhir.org/ig/Xt-EHR/xt-ehr-common/branches/patient-summary/artifacts.html#ehds-patient-summary-logical-models)

### EHDS ePrescription and eDispense Logical Models

| :--- | :--- |
| [Medication dispense decline model](StructureDefinition-EHDSDispenseDecline.md) | Explicit statement about declining the dispense request (prescription), usually recorded in order to communicate the issue back to the prescriber. Reasons for declining a dispense may vary, but typically this statement is only sent when a following action is expected on the prescriber’s side (cancelling or changing the problematic prescription or the whole treatment). |

### EHDS Imaging Domain Logical Models 

Information Models for implementing EEHRxF services in the imaging domain under EHDS. Format based on ISO 13972 "Health informatics — Clinical information models — Characteristics, structures and requirements."

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Imaging report model](StructureDefinition-EHDSImagingReport.md) | Imaging report reflects the observations and interpretations of one or more imaging studies, contains elements such as the reason why the study is requested, relevant contextual medical information, the modality used to acquire images and its settings, procedures and body localisations that were used, a description of the observations and findings, exposure information, conclusion and advice. |
| [Imaging study model](StructureDefinition-EHDSImagingStudy.md) | Imaging study model includes the key information about the content of an imaging study. It does not include image pixels but includes location pointers to its image content and organises this information according to the well-established model of an imaging study made of one or more series and each series made of instances or images. Composed of a set of data (DICOM KOS) that facilitates the location of all available images. |

### EHDS Discharge Report Domain Logical Models 

Information Models for implementing EEHRxF Discharge report under EHDS. Format based on ISO 13972 "Health informatics — Clinical information models — Characteristics, structures and requirements."
