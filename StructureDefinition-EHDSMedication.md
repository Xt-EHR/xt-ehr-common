| Active as of 2025-10-10 | *Computable Name*:EHDSMedication |

 
Logical model for prescribed/dispensed medication. The model is shared by statements, requests, dispensations, and treatment lines. Each of those may have different restrictions in FHIR profile. Model is suitable for generic/virtual medications as well as branded/real products. 

**Usages:**

* Use this Logical Model: [Immunisation model](StructureDefinition-EHDSImmunisation.md), [Medication administration model](StructureDefinition-EHDSMedicationAdministration.md), [Medication dispense model](StructureDefinition-EHDSMedicationDispense.md), [Medication prescription model](StructureDefinition-EHDSMedicationPrescription.md)...Show 2 more,[Medication statement model](StructureDefinition-EHDSMedicationStatement.md)and[Service request model](StructureDefinition-EHDSServiceRequest.md)
