EHDS refined base model for This type is for containing or referencing attachments - additional data content defined in other formats. The most common use of this type is to include images or reports in some report format such as PDF. However, it can be used for any data that has a MIME type. 

**Usages:**

* Use this Logical Model: [Advance directive model](StructureDefinition-EHDSAdvanceDirective.md), [Discharge Report model](StructureDefinition-EHDSDischargeReport.md), [Document model](StructureDefinition-EHDSDocument.md), [Imaging report model](StructureDefinition-EHDSImagingReport.md)...Show 3 more,[Laboratory report model](StructureDefinition-EHDSLaboratoryReport.md),[Media model](StructureDefinition-EHDSMedia.md)and[Medication prescription model](StructureDefinition-EHDSMedicationPrescription.md)
