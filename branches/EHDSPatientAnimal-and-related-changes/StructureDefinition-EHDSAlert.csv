Example 1: intolerance to aspirin due to gastrointestinal bleeding.
Example 2: intolerance to captopril because of cough (the patient is not allergic but can't tolerate it because of persistent cough)
Example 3: the patient has a rare disease that requires special treatment
Example 4: Airway Alert / Difficult Intubation
Example 5: Diagnoses such as malignant hyperthermia, porphyria, and bleeding disorders; special treatments like anticoagulants or immunosuppressants; implanted devices.
Example 6: transplanted organs illustrate other information that has to be taken into account in a healthcare contact.
Example 7: participation in a clinical trial that has to be taken into account in a healthcare contact.","","","","","","","","","",,,,,"",,,,"Base",0,*,"","","n/a"
